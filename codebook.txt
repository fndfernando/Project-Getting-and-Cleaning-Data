Tidy Data about Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set - Codebook

This experiment is about clear up a data set who was collect with voluntary using a Smartphone that have accelerometer and gyroscope so that categorize the measures in six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING). The result is a mean of all measures collected

The measures collected were:

 1-Activitylabel                                              : The name of activity

And this dates have four sub-categories:
* Time and Frequency : Time was captured a constante rate of 50 Hz and Frequency are this date aplly a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
* X,Y and Z - is used to denote the direction onde the 3 axial signals X,Y and Z
* Magnitude - the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals using the Euclidean norm
* Mean and Standard - indicate the value is a Mean ou a Standard

So that without this sub-categories we will have:
BodyAcceleration      : The acceleration of the body
BodyGyroscope         : The linear angular velocity
GravityAcceleration   : The acceleration of the gravity
BodyGyroscopeJerk     : The linear angular velocity derived Jerk signal
BodyAccelerationJerk  : The linear acceleration derived Jerk signal
